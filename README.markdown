# Chirpstream

Chirpstream is a xmpp (jabber) bot that connects to twitter's user stream api.

# Status

Currently the user stream api is in beta with limited capability.  This should
only be used for development until twitter finally releases it from beta later
this year.

# Purpose

This is going to be my biggest python project yet and using it as a learning
exercise.  This means everything will be built from scratch so no forking of
existing twitter libraries or anything.

# Requirements

* Python v2.6
* [twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/) - specifics will be mentioned once
  I figure it out myself
